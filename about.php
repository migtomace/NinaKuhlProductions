                <p>Nina has been singing karaoke since 1987 and hosted one karaoke show at the time.

During this time, Nina, with the help of Jim, owned a mobile dj business, catering to weddings & corporate parties.

During that time, Nina still DJ'd and ran  a successful Karaoke show  in the bar and also ran shows for private parties, corporate parties,  organized and ran local fundraisers for charities and is <a href="https://elkgrovewesternfestival.org/">The Elk Grove Western Festival</a> Stage Director for The Western Idol Stage and was Stage Director for the Velvet Rope Film Festival.
